### This project was a Front End challenge to work at Intellie


You can see the challenge here

https://github.com/intelie/challenge-chart-plot


For this project I used some dependencies like:

json5 - To deal with the data format.

ace-builds - To create the code editor.

highcharts and highcharts-react-official - To generate the chart.

To deal with the huge amount of data, I've created a limitation of data, getting only the last 8 more recent lines.

However, if I had more time, I would probably try instead to limit the records, give the user an average of min_response_time and max_responde_time for each type.

When I started to develop, my thought was that it was as simple as possible and with the least number of dependencies possible.

I like to follow the idea of ​​pure functions and create reusable components.

The tests were simple

I didn't do interface tests, just unit tests.

The project was done in a day and a half, I wish I had more time, to do more things.

At the time of delivery of this challenge, I am involved in other projects that do not allow me to dedicate myself to this one during the week.

I found it a little difficult, because I did not know the context of the data and information that would need to be generated, but I hope that it met expectations

If everything went well, today I must be working at Intellie, let's see.
